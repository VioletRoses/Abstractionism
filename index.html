        <h3 class="right">Social media is absolutely terrible for my mental health, and I understand that, so why do I keep using it?</h3>
        <h2 class="center">It's kind of strange that my favorite version of Smash Bros is Project M, a mod for my least favorite Smash game of all time.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h4 class="left">Sometimes it feels like I'm never <i>truly</i> good at anything compared to others. I'm probably right, there always will be someone better than me at everything I try. I just wish I could <strong>stop giving a fuck</strong> about it already.</h4>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h1 class="left">I should probably stop arguing so much on Twitter.</h1>
        <h3 class="left">Or maybe just be a bit nicer when I do get into arguments.</h3>
        <h2 class="center">Audiophile elitism can be downright bizarre. You really think burning a CD slower will change how it sounds?</h2>
        <h5 class="center">And that's coming from someone that replaced their amp with an expensive tube amp because <em>"it sounds better"</em></h5>

        <h3 class="right">Sometimes I wonder what would happen if AWS completely vanished.</h3>
        <p class="right" style="font-size: 80%;">Though obviously that would <em>never</em> happen, Amazon is way too large</p>
        <h2 class="right">Please stop making Electron apps, my computer <strong>can't take it</strong></h2>
        <h1 class="left">will amogus ever die</h1>
        <h2 class="center">I wonder what my life would be like if I never educated myself and grew out of my anti-SJW edgelord phase.</h2>
        <h4 class="center">Probably not great, I don't know how I could have coped with dysphoria while being surrounded by a bunch of unsympathetic asshats.</h4>
        <h6 class="center">Unfortunately some of those "asshats" are in my family.</h6>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="left"><strong>I hope nobody is actually reading this garbage lmfao</strong></h2>
        <h4 class="right">I appreciate the interest though.</h4>
        <h3 class="right">It kind of seems like NFTs just became irrelevant one day, I wonder what happened. No seriously, I've been vehemently anti-NFT for a long time and I can't explain why they just stopped being popular (other than the fact that NFTs are stupid as hell and almost 99% of projects are scams)</h3>
